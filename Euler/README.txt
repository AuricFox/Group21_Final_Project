edges.txt: 
	- File that contains all directed edges. Created by printing set from main.py

eulerianCycle.py:
	- Computes and prints eulerian circuit from spike_protein_directed_graph.txt

eulerianPath.py:
	- Computes and prints eulerian path from spike_protein_directed_graph.txt

main.py:
	- Only change is the create_directed_graph function which creates spike_protein_directed_graph.txt

spike_protein_directed_graph.txt:
	- A directed graph where the graph is given in the form of an adjacency list (from edges.txt)
